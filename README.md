# hangman
Hangman project with The Odin Project.




On Gitpod use ./run to start hangman.




I tried to get this working on Repl but had an absolute nightmare trying to get the tty-prompt Gem to work on there. 
At least I learnt about about Gitpod while doing this and also how to create a bash file!
